        Checks for virtual drift between model and stream data windows.

        This method is intended to compute a divergence measure (e.g., JS divergence) between the distributions of data in the model window and the stream window to detect virtual drift. Currently, it checks for basic conditions that might indicate drift, such as empty model windows or mismatched window lengths.

        Args:
            model_window (List): List representing the model data window.
            stream_window (List): List representing the stream data window.

        Returns:
            bool: True if conditions indicating potential virtual drift are met. Currently, returns True if the model window is empty or if the lengths of model and stream windows mismatch.

        Todo:
            Implement the calculation of JS/KL divergence between model window and stream window distributions.
